Solve the crossword puzzle located at https://ctf.cisaicsctf.com/crossword to reveal the flag.

Flag format: flag will appear next to a flag icon in the lower-left corner of the crossword webpage once the puzzle has been solved. Example: flag-123456789a
```

Solution:

This challenge is pretty straightforward. You just solve the crossword and the flag shows up at the end. I was able to see the flag, before entering the last 3 words as well. I will post the questions towards the end if you want to reference that as well.
